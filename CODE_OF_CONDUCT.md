# Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Google Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google.com/conduct/).

We expect all contributors to engage with respect, kindness, and professionalism toward one another. Disagreements and conflicts should be addressed thoughtfully, calmly, and constructively, with the intention of finding mutually respectful solutions. Everyone is expected to contribute in a manner that fosters positive, collaborative interactions.

Behavior or language that may cause harm, discomfort, or embarrassment to others is unacceptable. This includes but is not limited to, discrimination, harassment, and hate speech based on race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any other identity. Specifically, behaviors such as racism, sexism, ableism, or any form of harmful exclusion or stereotyping are not tolerated.

Participants should avoid making inappropriate jokes or comments about their colleagues, as well as engaging in any form of unwanted physical contact. This ensures we create a respectful environment for everyone, regardless of their background, identity, or experiences.

In situations where harmful behavior occurs, disciplinary actions may be taken. One possible consequence could be temporary or permanent silencing within the community to protect individuals from harm and to maintain a safe space for all. Our aim is to create a welcoming, inclusive, and supportive environment where all participants feel respected and valued.

We embrace diverse perspectives and experiences, encouraging open and respectful discussions, so that all voices are heard and supported.
