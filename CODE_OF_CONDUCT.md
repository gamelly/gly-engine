# Code Of Conduct

This project adheres to both the [Google Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.google/documentation/reference/releasing/template/CODE_OF_CONDUCT) and the [Google Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google.com/conduct/).
In essence, we ask all contributors to act with respect and courtesy toward one another. Disagreements and conflicts should be addressed in a calm, constructive, and peaceful manner, with the goal of finding mutually agreeable solutions.
It is essential that no one engages in behavior or language that could cause discomfort, embarrassment, or harm to others. Participants are also expected to refrain from making inappropriate jokes or comments about colleagues, as well as from any unwanted physical contact.

We strive to maintain a welcoming, inclusive, and safe environment for everyone, embracing diverse perspectives and experiences.
All voices are valued, and we encourage open, respectful discussions, ensuring that everyone feels heard and supported, regardless of background, experience, or role.
