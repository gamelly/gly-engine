This step is important for you to get valid `id` and `package` generated randomly, to use in your `meta`
```text
tizen create web-project -n YourAwesomeApplication -t WebBasicApplication -p tizen-8.0
```

@li **add metadata to your lua application**
```
local P = {
    meta={
        id='com.example.yourawesomeapplication-reverse-dns'
        title='Your Awesome Application',
        tizen_package='xxxxxxxxxxx'
    }
}
