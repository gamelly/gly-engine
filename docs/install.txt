## unique lua file

@note @b Attention! that although it is a `.lua` file, @n it is obfuscating in a way, to browse the source code use `lua cli.lua cli-dump`

### curl

```
wget get.gamely.com.br/cli.lua -o cli.lua
```

### wget

```
wget get.gamely.com.br/cli.lua
```

now you need a lua to execute a cli!

```
lua cli.lua version
```
