@page ginga_bug_capabilities Capabilities are falsely in all devices

@li variable: settings.system.luaSupportedEventClasses
@li Ginga CCWS: /dtv/platform-capabilities

@b problem:
This affects all devices regardless of brand, allowing for the indication of *unsupported working features*
while also claiming *support for a non-existent feature* in the middleware.
(Samsung and LG are confirmed)

@n @b solution:
Anything that doesn't crash should be tested instead of asking support.

@page ginga_bug_samsung_host HTTP host identification Samsung 2021

@b problem: 
Some Samsung television models from 2021 onwards have the behavior of returning the TCP class to the host with IP even if you have passed a domain,
when working with multiple requests at the same time this makes it impossible to identify the origin of the request.
(confirmed)

@n @b solution: 
The first request made with a domain is used to check for the existence of this behavior. When detected,
each new domain is blocked by multiple requests to make a request just to resolve the DNS. After that,
it is cached to ensure there is an understanding between the connection ID, host and IP.

@page ginga_bug_155 HTTP disconnect crash LG 2024

@li https://github.com/gly-engine/gly-engine/issues/155

@b problem: 
LGs have incremental connection IDs starting from 0.
There appears to be an issue where posting a disconnect event with ID 0 in the TCP class of the Ginga
implemented by LG causes the application to crash. It is not possible to capture this with pcall in Lua.
(not confirmed)

@n @b solution: 
The engine's legacy http protocol already chose to make a first separate request to test DNS and Network,
the alternative was to just comment on this first connection, it is up to the server to disconnect the socket.

@page ginga_bug_190 Telemedia swaped key events

@li https://github.com/TeleMidia/ginga/issues/190
@li https://github.com/TeleMidia/ginga/issues/173

@b problem: 
For some mysterious reason, the [Telemidia Ginga simulator](https://github.com/TeleMidia/ginga) has swapped the `pressed` and `released` events.
However, this issue only occurs in the `ginga` (CLI) command and not in `gingagui` which uses the same codebase but with an interface. 
(confirmed)

@n @b solution: 
For testing purposes with the engine (CLI), there is the `--telemedia190` building flag,
which compiles the engine with the swapped events. This can be useful when combined with the `--run` flag to immediately test after the build.

@page bug_ginga_gc_clean Lua GC clear in Sony/TOTVS

@b problem:
the lua `collectgarbage()` function causes the black screen.

@n @b solution:
dont use it.

@page bug_ginga_canvas_samsung NCL Canvas opacity Samsung

@b problem:
In all Samsung models, when painting a rectangle with an opaque color in front of a PNG image, the image is clipped and ends up with 100% transparency.
This behavior appears to be the result of a misconfigured blend mode.
(confirmed)

@n @b solution:
use another image of a solid square in the desired color if possible, or a color similar to the PNG that is not opaque.

@page bug_ginga_resolution_percentage NCL resolution percentage

@b problem: 
Old sony televison (no longer sold in brazil) do not recognize percentages in the `region` parameter when associeated with the `descriptor`
used by a `media` with the source `sbtvd-ts://video` instead, they interprete it as pixel size, which causes the video to appear small on the screen.
(not confirmed)

@n @b solution:
pixel size should be used, or the `sbtvd-ts://video` media should be omitted, you are not required to declare if you dont want to interact with attributes.

@page bug_ginga_lua_starting_media NCL start media using lua

@b problem: 
The activation process, triggered by an NCL event posted by Lua, is excessively complicated and not supported on Samsung and LG TVs at least until 2021.
However, there is evidence that the encoding is correct, as the Telemedia simulator is working.
(confirmed)

@n @b solution:
not resolved. <!-- make the L -->
