## Framework

The engine is multi-platform and can even be embedded within another engine, such as @b Love2D, which is widely used for developing new systems.
It offers interfaces tailored to the target platform on which the game will run.

If youâ€™re organizing your project with multiple code files and numerous assets,
the CLI includes a bundler that can assist you with that, actually worry about your input code from a @b game.lua file, when you're ready,
you can use a template and drag your game to distribute, or use the CLI to extract the parts of the engine needed for your game to run.
