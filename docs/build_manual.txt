@short port from scratch
@brief support the engine on some custom platform building from scratch
@warning <strong>This is an advanced API!</strong>@n only for advanced programmers, You might be lost if you are a beginner.
@details You can easily port the Gly Engine to any platform by following a few straight forward steps.
The main requirement is to create interfaces that connect with the native graphics libraries and hardware specific to your platform.
Here’s how to get started:

@li <strong>Implement a Micro Engine:</strong>
Develop a small engine that serves as a wrapper around the graphics libraries available on your target platform.
This micro engine will handle all low-level graphics operations.

@li <strong>Ensure Lua Support:</strong>
Embed some Lua distribution in your software, even if you intend to use other languages ​​such as JavaScript (like QuickJS),
all the main behavior of the engine is written in Lua, if you are using a version of Lua that is not compatible,
you can open an issue that we can work on in support.

@li <strong>Initialize the Engine:</strong>
After you’ve set up your micro engine and ensured Lua is ready,
you can load the Gly Engine.You need to call a specific function to initialize the engine within your application.
Use the function @c native_callback_init to properly set everything up.

By following these steps, you can effectively port the Gly Engine to any platform of your choice. 

@note the functions are represented in C, but just so you understand the typing,
in fact you have to manipulate the Lua VM stack in most cases.

@page framework_functions Global lua functions

Using the [Lua C API](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html#p4), you must expose these functions to your Lua VM,
so that the engine can communicate with the low-level resources of the system.

#### API Level 0

Even if you have nothing to do in @c draw or @c loop of a game,
these functions will be called to the microengine to know the start and end of the intention to paint each frame.

```
void native_draw_start()
```

```
void native_draw_flush()
```

#### API Level 1

```
void native_draw_color(int color)
```

```
void native_draw_clear(int color)
```

```
void native_draw_rect(int mode, double x, double y, double width, double heigth)
```

#### API Level 2

```
void native_draw_line(double x1, double y1, double x1, double y1)
```

```
void native_draw_text(double x, double y, char* text)
```

```
void native_draw_font(int size)
```

```
void native_draw_font(char* name, int size)
```

@page framework_callbacks Global lua callbacks

#### API Level 1

```
void native_callback_loop(double dt)
```

```
void native_callback_draw()
```

```
void native_callback_keyboard(char* key, bool value)
```

```
void native_callback_init(width, height, game_lua)
```

#### API Level 2

```
void native_callback_resize(double width, double height)
```

@page framework_examples Examples

#### native_draw_line in SDL2

```
/// @short @c std.draw.line
/// @param[in] x1 @c double
/// @param[in] y1 @c double
/// @param[in] x2 @c double
/// @param[in] y2 @c double
static int native_draw_line(lua_State *L) {
    assert(lua_gettop(L) == 4);

    float x1 = luaL_checknumber(L, 1);
    float y1 = luaL_checknumber(L, 2);
    float x2 = luaL_checknumber(L, 3);
    float y2 = luaL_checknumber(L, 4);
    
    SDL_RenderDrawLineF(renderer, x1, y1, x2, y2);

    lua_pop(L, 4);

    return 0;
}
```

#### micro-engine start

```
void gly_engine_start()
{
    luaL_loadbuffer(L, engine_bytecode_lua, engine_bytecode_lua_len, "");
	lua_pcall(L, 0, 0, 0);

    lua_getglobal(L, "native_callback_init");
    lua_pushnumber(L, 1280);
    lua_pushnumber(L, 720);

    luaL_loadbuffer(L, game_bytecode_lua, game_bytecode_lua_len, "");
	lua_pcall(L, 0, 1, 0);
    lua_pcall(L, 3, 0, 0);
}
```

#### micro-engine loop

```
void gly_engine_loop()
{
    lua_getglobal(L, "native_callback_loop");
    lua_pushnumber(L, 16);
    lua_pcall(L, 1, 0, 0);
    lua_getglobal(L, "native_callback_draw");
    lua_pushnumber(L, 16);
    lua_pcall(L, 1, 0, 0);
    usleep(16000);
}
```
