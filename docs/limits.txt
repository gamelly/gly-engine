@page limits Limitations

## Love2d

love 2d would be the hardware of your computer or video game, it has no performance limitations but some features are unavailable.

#### Polygons

It's a problem that <strong>Love2D itself doesn't support open polygons like wireframes</strong>,
so it's not possible to bring it in an optimized way to engine.

@li polygon with 3 vertice are supported as open wireframes, but cannot be filled.
@li to fill a polygon with 3 vertices, just make a 4th point that is aligned.

## Ginga

Ginga doesn't have as much firepower, although it has a lot of available memory,
it is running at low CPU priority, which can significantly hinder the Lua language from running quickly.

#### Polygons

filled pylogons are not supported.

#### HTTPS

does not support requests with SSL and also HTTP 2.0 or higher.

## Gameboy Advanced

@ref build_gba does not have an FPU so the lua number type is emulated via software by the compiler, 
it is also CPU is 16.78 MHz with 288 KB of RAM, so don't expect to make a big game, but it is a good hobby,
if you make a well optimized code you can play at 30 or 60 FPS.

#### Clear

Don't change colors too often with @c std.draw.clear as this is expensive,
if you always keep the same color you will never have a problem.

@li can only be called at the start of a draw.

#### Rects

Don't draw giant filled squares, it can drop your FPS every time you try.

#### Polygons

filled pylogons are not supported.

#### Divisions / Multiplications

Avoid doing multiplications and divisions of non-base 2 numbers during the game loop, this really negatively impacts the game's performance.

@li <strong>dont</strong>
@code
x = x + (game.hspeed * 3)
@endcode

@li <strong>works better</strong>
@code
x = x + speed + (speed * 2)
@endcode

#### Texts

Long texts are expensive, and can cause synchronization problems at +30 FPS <i>(especially at the top of the screen)</i>,
avoid filling the screen with text if you are playing a game and not reading a book.

@li prefer to write texts at the bottom of the screen
@li code yours @c std.draw.text in end of the of @c draw callback
