## Stability Notice  

Game engines are complex by nature, and **Gly Engine is still in its early stages**. It **cannot yet be considered stable**, and **breaking changes may occur in any release**.
We carefully design our APIs to be stable and future-proof, but until the engine matures, **using it in production is at your own risk**.
